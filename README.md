# COMP0020-Functional-Programming

Answers to questions in the assessment for COMP0020 (A6U, A7P). The code is written in Miranda not Haskell. The assessment consists of TWO questions. 

Question 1 is on the lambda calculus and how it is used in the implementation of functional languages. Question 2 is a substantial programming challenge, which is to simulate the operation of a free-list memory allocator that manages blocks of variable size, coupled with a mark-scan garbage collector.
